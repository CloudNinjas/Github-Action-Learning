All actions are written in basic yml language, that describe easy what the runner should do when the action is triggered. In this "Hello World" example we will go through the basic parts of the yml file and explain how each of that parts in a basic action are used.

But first a screenshot of the UI if you just use the default basic hello world example from github.com
